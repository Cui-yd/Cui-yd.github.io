Welcome to my homepage! I recently received my PhD in Biostatistics from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhangsheng Yu](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher/en/ZhangshengYu).

My research centers on developing statistical methods for high-dimensional omics data and complex phenotypes. Specifically, I am working on high-dimensional mediation analysis using DNA methylation data and rare variant association analysis based on whole-genome sequencing datasets. I also maintain a strong research interest in transcriptomics.

Please feel free to contact me.        
Cheers!
